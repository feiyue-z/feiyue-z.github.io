    <h1>About me</h1>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Hello, I am a first-year master's student at Brown University. ğŸ“š</p>

    <p>My interest in computers began to develop when I first started playing video games (some of my favorites include The Sims and RollerCoaster Tycoon ğŸš€). The beautiful visuals and the sense of immersion in the experience have shaped my passion for software development.</p>

    <p>Now I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction, AR/VR, and 3D graphics. ğŸ¥½</p>
