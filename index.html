  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Hello, I am a student studying Computer Science who will graduate in May 2025.</p>

    <p>My professional experience includes full-stack development, where I've built services using popular frameworks, as well as lower-level programming in C++ for low-latency applications.</p>

    <p>During my graduate studies, I shifted my focus to game development, AR/VR, and computer graphics, and I am now seeking job opportunities in these fields.</p>
