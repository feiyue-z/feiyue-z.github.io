    <h1>About me</h1>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Hello, I am a first-year master's student at Brown University.</p>

    <p>My interest in computers began to develop when I started playing video games. I could spend days and nights playing some of my favorite simulation games, such as The Sims and RollerCoaster Tycoon. The beautiful visuals and the sense of immersion in the experience had shaped my interests in software development for today.</p>

    <p>I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction, AR/VR, and 3D graphics.</p>
